Ubuntu
------

Icarra requires the PyQt GUI library.  Ubuntu will install the required libraries using apt-get.  PyQt may also be installed from source in which case two separate libraries must be installed: SIP (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/download) and PyQt (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download).

The following commands will install the required libraries:

sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo apt-get install python-qt

cd icarra2/installed/sgmlop
sudo python setup.py install

cd icarra2/installed/python-jsonrpc
sudo python setup.py install

cd icarra2/installed/feedparser
sudo python setup.py install

Sqlite3 is a useful tool that can be used to view Icarra's databases:

sudo apt-get install sqlite3

Windows

Download and install PyQt from Riverbank computing.  The most recent url is http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download.  You can build from sourec or use the installer.  If you choose to download the installer make sure you pick the correct installer for your version of python.

You need to make sure the PyQt DLLs are in your path.  If you are using the bashs shell under cygwin the command might look like this:

    export PATH="{$PATH}:/cygdrive/c/Python26/Lib/site-packages/PyQt4/bin"
