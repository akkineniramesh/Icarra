Ubuntu
------

Icarra requires the PyQt GUI library.  Ubuntu will install the required libraries using apt-get.  PyQt may also be installed from source in which case two separate libraries must be installed: SIP (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/download) and PyQt (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download).

The following commands will install the required libraries:

sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo apt-get install python-qt

Download sgmlop from http://effbot.org/zone/sgmlop-index.htm
sudo python setup.py install

Download python-jsonrpc from http://json-rpc.org/wiki/python-json-rpc
sudo python setup.py install

Download feedparser from http://www.feedparser.org/
sudo python setup.py install

Sqlite3 is a useful tool that can be used to view Icarra's databases:

sudo apt-get install sqlite3

Windows
-------

Download and install PyQt from Riverbank computing.  The most recent url is http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download.  You can build from sourec or use the installer.  If you choose to download the installer make sure you pick the correct installer for your version of python.

You need to make sure the PyQt DLLs are in your path.  If you are using the bashs shell under cygwin the command might look like this:

    export PATH="{$PATH}:/cygdrive/c/Python26/Lib/site-packages/PyQt4/bin"

Download sgmlop from http://effbot.org/zone/sgmlop-index.htm
sudo python setup.py install

Download python-jsonrpc from http://json-rpc.org/wiki/python-json-rpc
sudo python setup.py install

Download feedparser from http://www.feedparser.org/
sudo python setup.py install

OS X

Same instructions as windows.  Do not need to set PATH.
